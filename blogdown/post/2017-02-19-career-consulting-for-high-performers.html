<p>It has been over three years since I signed up as a career mentor for <a href="https://www.geteverwise.com/">Everwise</a>. It is a volunteer work, which I committed about one hour each month to meet my protégé for their career development needs. I myself have got a lot of help along my career, this is a work to give back to the community and reach out to more people.</p>
<p>This site is to provide a reflection to the topics and discussions. Provide materials for future protégés. The topics would be general without disclosing confidentiality of my proteges.</p>
<p>The matched protégés are all coming from Silicon Valley high tech companies such as Google, Instacart, Saleforce and high growth start-up companies in San Francisco Bay Area. I would categorize them in the high performers (HiPo). Therefore the title.</p>

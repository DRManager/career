It has been over three years since I signed up as a career mentor for [Everwise](https://www.geteverwise.com/). It is a volunteer work, which I committed about one hour each month to meet my protégé for their career development needs. I myself have got a lot of help along my career, this is a work to give back to the community and reach out to more people. 

This site is to provide a reflection to the topics and discussions. Provide materials for future protégés. The topics would be general without disclosing confidentiality of my proteges.


The matched protégés are all coming from Silicon Valley high tech companies such as Google, Saleforce and high growth start-up comapnies. I would categorize them in the high performers (HiPo). Therefore the title.

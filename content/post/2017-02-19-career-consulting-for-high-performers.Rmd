It has been over three years since I signed up as a career adviser for Everwise. It is a volunteer work which I committed 1 hour each month to conference call or meet with pretoge for their career development needs. I would refelect that I learn much from this experience.

This site is to provide a reflection to the topics and discussions. Provide materials for future proteges. The topics would be general without disclosing confidentiality of my proteges.

The matched proteges are all coming from Silicon Valley high tech companies. I would categorize them in the high performer. Therefore the title.

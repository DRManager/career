It is a volunteer work, which I committed about one hour each month to meet my protégé for their career development needs.

&lt;p&gt;This site is to provide a reflection to the topics and discussions. Provide materials for future protégés. The topics would be general without disclosing confidentiality of my proteges.&lt;/p&gt;
